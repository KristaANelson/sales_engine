# Sales Engine - 
This 2 week paired project, a data reporting tool that manipulates and reports on merchant transactional data. This project was completed in only Ruby, and did not allow Databases, ActiveRecord library, Struct or OpenStruct, or Metaprogramming. 

**Goals:** 
Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
Build a complex system of relationships using multiple interacting classes
Demonstrate the DRY principle with modules and/or duck typing
Separate parsing and data loading logic from business logic
Use memoization to improve performance
